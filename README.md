## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository for the Superheroes API.

## Collaboration strategy

I would collaborate with a teammate by:

- Properly defined the goal of the API, and the endpoints that are needed
- Pair programming when needed
- Code review for each other's code, and decide together on the best approach

## If I had more time

- Would make humility score a value generated based on more parameters
- Would generate a superhero thumbnail image with generative AI based on their name, superpower and humility score
- I would add more tests, both unit and e2e
- Add more validation for the input data
- Improve by adding pagination for the superheroes / maybe implement NEST Crud for convenience
- Consider a seed script to add dummy data
- Persistent DB integration
- Dockerize the app for deployment convenience
- Add swagger for API documentation / testing / OpenAPI generation
